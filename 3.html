  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
    event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
    with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
    and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language
    itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
    networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host
    environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers,
    but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js.
    They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with
    frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
